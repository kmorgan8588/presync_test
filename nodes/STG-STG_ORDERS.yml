        Orders are not present for all customers. In fact, one-third of the customers do not have any order in
        the database. The orders are assigned at random to two-thirds of the customers (see Clause 4: ). The purpose of
        this is to exercise the capabilities of the DBMS to handle "dead data" when joining two or more tables.
